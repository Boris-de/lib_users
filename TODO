- Docs on what may turn up as deleted in maps files are skimpy at best. Get
  more false positives from users.
- Maybe come up with a way to find the actual script for the interpreter case.
  Note: *Don't* use heuristics. Madness lies that way. Systemd already
  provides a mechanism for this and lib_users uses it with -S. Maybe
  other systems provide something similar.
